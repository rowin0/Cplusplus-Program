# Cplusplus-Project three
## Description
The purpose of this project is to develop a program for The Corner Grocer that analyzes daily sales data recorded in a txt file that contains a chronological list of items purchased throughout the day, from store opening to closing. The program creates a backup file (frequency.dat) that stores every item along with the number of times it was purchased. Also, the program creates a menu where the user can select to search for an item, print the list frequency or create a histogram of the list frequency.
## What was done well
I think one of the strongest aspects of this project was developing a data structure that could be easily written to a file and displayed on the console.The creation of an efficient data structure capable of being both written to a file and printed to the console was a particularly strong component of this project.
## Most challenging part
The toughest part of this project was definitely getting the histogram to display correctly in the console. It took some careful string formatting in C++ to pull the right data from the file stream. It required a bit more brain power than expected, but after searching on Google how to parse input strings and testing a few ideas I found online, I was able to find a working solution.
## Transferrable skills
The biggest takeaway from this project for me was learning how to work with input streams, like reading data from a file, and turning that information into a data structure that can be used in different ways. I feel that this skill is at the core of many tasks in computer science.
## Code maintainence
Breaking the code into smaller, modular functions makes it much easier to maintain and expand later on than trying to manage one large block of code. Adding clear comments also helps my future self or other developers quickly understand how everything fits together.
