# Cplusplus-Project three
## Description
The purpose of this project is to develop a program for The Corner Grocer that analyzes daily sales data recorded in a txt file that contains a chronological list of items purchased throughout the day, from store opening to closing. The program creates a backup file (frequency.dat) that stores every item along with the number of times it was purchased. Also, the program creates a menu where the user can select to search for an item, print the list frequency or create a histogram of the list frequency.
## What was done well
I think one of the strongest aspects of this project was developing a data structure that could be easily written to a file and displayed on the console.The creation of an efficient data structure capable of being both written to a file and printed to the console was a particularly strong component of this project.
