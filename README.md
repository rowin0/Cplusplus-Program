# Cplusplus-Project three
## Description
The purpose of this project is to develop a program for The Corner Grocer that analyzes daily sales data recorded in a txt file that contains a chronological list of items purchased throughout the day, from store opening to closing. The program creates a backup file (frequency.dat) that stores every item along with the number of times it was purchased. Also, the program creates a menu where the user can select to search for an item, print the list frequency or create a histogram of the list frequency.
